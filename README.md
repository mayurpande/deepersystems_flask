In order for project to create an env file.

> .env 

In here put the mongo db uri, so for example something like this;

> MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.pyron.mongodb.net/<collection>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

Where <username> is the db username, <password> is the db user's password and <collection> is the collection for the db.
